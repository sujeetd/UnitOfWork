# UnitOfWork
This is not a solution or a complete example project but rather set of plain c# code for organizing UnitOfWork pattern 
that can use either Entity Framework or ADO.net with SQL or Stored procedure. It can be used with DI framework within MVC 
or in the given example framework dependency is introdced as part of BL layer so that MVC does not have be aware about ORM framework
implentation and BL layer could be used outside MVC too.
